# Project 7 (Julien Lamalle)

### This project was done in python <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="python" width="30" height="30"/>



To clone this folder, execute the following command: 

```
git clone git@github.com:JulienLamalle/OC_DA_PYTHON_7.git
```

From your terminal you can enter the file as follows: 

```
cd OC_DA_PYTHON_7
```

To avoid conflicts with potential existing projects I strongly recommend that you create a virtual environment for this project using this command:

```
python -m venv env
```

Then you have to activate your environment:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

You now need to install all the libraries necessary for this program to work properly, for this you can run the following command: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You are now with your console in the program folder so... you can use the bruteforce algorithm to test a csv file of 20 actions:

```
python bruteforce.py
```

Or, you can use a dynamic algorithm to test three files (you determine which one you want to use by uncommenting the relevant line in the `optmized.py` file, then you just use the following command : 


```
python optimized.py
```

### ENJOY ðŸŽ‰ !
